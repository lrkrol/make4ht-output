<!-- l. 19 --><p class='noindent'>A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a neurotechnological system that allows human
mental states to be directly accessed by a computer. To that end, the BCI system
reads human brain activity, most commonly using electroencephalography (EEG),
applies a number of signal processing and feature extraction steps, and employs
machine learning algorithms in order to classify the resulting features as being
indicative of certain mental states. This was first demonstrated in the 1970s
has been under continuous development ever since, primarily in medical
contexts. Here, BCI systems are envisioned to, for example, enable paralysed or
otherwise motor-impaired patients to regain independence by replacing natural
neural pathways with BCIs. However, more than that can be done with
technology that has direct access to human mental states. Zander in particular
introduced the concept of <span class='cmti-10'>passive </span>BCIs, where technology uses arbitrary, naturally
occurring mental states as input, as opposed to those <span class='cmti-10'>active </span>BCIs that are
used for intentional, direct communication and control. This latter category
simply replaces existing means of control with a BCI. The former, however,
enables new forms of <span class='cmti-10'>implicit </span>human-computer interaction, through which
technology can automatically adapt to its human user, without this user actively
communicating anything, or even being aware of any communication taking
place.
